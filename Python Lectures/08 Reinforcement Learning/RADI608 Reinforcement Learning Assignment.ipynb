    "Action: <code>Bahrami et al. (2022)</code> defined the set of actions $A$ to be the set of $k \\times k$ overlapping image patches that can be selected to be masked, creating a finite action space of size $|A| = k^2$ where $k$ is a hyperparameter. The agent selects a patch of the image to be occluded based on its reward estimation of masking for each patch. <code>Bahrami et al. (2022)</code> designed a one-step episodic problem in which the input image is the current state $s = x$ that creates a continuous infinite state space.\n"

    "The authors developed an environment for template-guided biopsy sampling of the cancer targets, the MDP components, and the policy learning strategy. The environment is a 2D-slice of an MR-derived biopsy environment where virtual biopsy needles can be inserted through the perineum via a brachytherapy template gtid consisting of $13 \\times 13$ holes that are 5 mm apart. There are certain considerations the author assumed in designing and constructing the adopted biopsy environment.\n",

    "1. The prostate gland from each MR volume, the MR-identified targets, and key landmarks such as the position of the rectum are all manually segmented from indivudal patients to construct the biopsy environment. \n",
    "2. Binary segmentation are provided as observations for the RL agents, as opposed to ultrasound image intensities, which are neither available during planning nor straightforward to synthesize from MR images. \n",
    "3. Uncertainty in MR-to-Ultrasound registration can be added to the segmented regions, together with other potential erros in localizing these errors during observation nsuch as observer variability in manual segmentation. "
